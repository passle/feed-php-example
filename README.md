Please note: 

  1. You'll need to replace the shortcode in the view with the shortcode of the Passle you are trying to display
> You can get this from the settings page of your Passle.
  2. The feed depends on JQuery >= v1.8.3 (It may work with some earlier versions of JQuery)
  3. The container `div` for the feed must have a class of `passle-shortcode`
